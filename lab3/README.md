# Attacks on the merchant protocol and its participants

Create an application that implements protocol attacks on installation
TCP connections and within a given application layer protocol.
The application interface should clearly present:
- Initial protocol data (modules, keys, flags, other data);
- Data transmitted over the network of each party;
- Checks performed by each of the participants.

The process of interaction between protocol parties can be implemented
using buffer variables.
It is also necessary to single out each of the stages of the attack in order to
could be separated from the rest.
