# Software protection from unauthorized use

Implement code obfuscation method
application developed as part of the laboratory work
to protect the software from unauthorized use in
the following combinations

- Test the functionality of the application with obfuscated
program code.
- Check and explain the following properties, which should
satisfy convoluted program:
    + Entanglement must be disguised. What to program
confusing transformations have been applied, should not be thrown
in the eyes.
    + Entanglement does not have to be regular. regular structure
confusing program or its fragment allows a person to separate
obfuscated parts and even identify the obfuscation algorithm.

When designing protection, it must be assumed that the application works with
a database in which the data entered by the user is stored.
