# Kerberos
Create an application that implements the Kerberos key distribution protocol, including retrieval, that implements the DES algorithm.
The application interface should include:
- Initial protocol data (modules, keys, secret data, etc.);
- Data transferred over the networks of each of the parties;
- Checks carried out by each of the participants.
The process of interaction between protocols can be used with the help of buffer exchanges. It is also necessary to highlight the protocols each time so that it can be separated from the rest.
